  error can cause subu-mk-0 to leave the creating of a subu in an intermediate
  state.  Rather than bailing on some of the errors we need to clean up instead.
  Perhaps the yet to be written subu-rm program will be resilent enough to do
  more general cleanup.

  need to modify subu-init to take a configuration file name argument instead of
  using a global variabel value.  might want to add arguments to other subu
  commands also

  in subu.lib.c append cascading rmdir failure mess to useradd failure mess

  want to add subu-type to masteru_subu(),  I imagine there will be static,
  permanent, and temporary subu types.

  the masteru subu relation should contain the uid of the masteru as
  well as the backup type for the subu:  git, rdiff, rsync, none.
  and the persisitance fo the subu: indefinite, session.
  seems that operations need to be logged, in case the db is lost
  the transcript can be played back.  It should also be possible
  to co-opt an existing user as a subu, though, would require
  sudo privs.

  need to add messages for subu errors I've added to the end of
  the list in subu.lib.c

   should mod all to he subudb routines to return a message, probably
   strdup(sqlite_errmsg(db)), then the callers to these routines can just pass
   mess in rather than making up new ones for each situation. The error code
   probably already carries the contexts specific message.  Or perhaps add
   a string cat function for message strings, that would run through a stream
   and free the originals.

   Really need to add a transcript to help recover if there are any problems.
