    A leaf type node specifies a path to a file that should not be deleted by
    the build scripts. Typically this is the source code. Optionally, the build
    scripts can mark such files as read only before the build, and thus the
    build code can not delete them without changing permissions.

The build code for a project should not delete certain files.

The Unix way: Say the builder and developer are different users.  The
developer puts the builder into his group. The group permissions are
set so that source code can not be deleted.  Great, but now the builder
will be the member of many developers.

...  so instead the builder is a sub user of the developer, and has
access via sharing with the sub user, either through group membership
or ACLS.
