For the following makefile, the .PHONY tag is ignored unless there
is an explicit target with that name.  The %:: target is not enough.
So for expample, if there is an exec directory, the exec target
caught through the %:: will never fire.  The commented lines must
be added that give an explicit exec target.


.PHONY: all version deps lib exec
all: version deps lib exec

lib:
	$(MAKE) $@
	cp src/tranche.lib.h include/tranche.h

#exec:
#	$(MAKE) $@

%::
	$(MAKE) $@
