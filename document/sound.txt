before changing users:

user must be in group audio

> sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils
> pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp

after changing users:

> export PULSE_SERVER=localhost

According to
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/CLI/#default.pa
the module load command goes in /etc/pulse/default.pa and the pactl command is not needed,
but this did not work:

  /etc/pulse/default.pa
  load-module module-native-protocol-tcp

this did not work
seems this must be run by the login user, not even root can do it:

 pactl load-module module-native-protocol-tcp

also requires restart of google-chrome etc.

for now I will add this the .bashrc file for admin
