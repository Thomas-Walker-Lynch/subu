da_erase  ; same as da_free, don't tell anyone

da_integer_repeats ; all items in the array are equal
da_integer_sum ; sum all elements
               da_integer_transpose  ; matrix transpose
da_integer_repeats_column ; all columns are equal

da_every_column ;  like every but for columns instead of elements
da_every_row    ;  like every but for rows





da_push_row ; push rows/vectors/das onto dama
da_integer_repeats_row ; transpose and call repeats column


transpose needs to output a DaMa, not a raw image matrix, though it can use one to get there if need be

then add integer repeats row which will use transpose and column repeats to do its job

then add da_push_row to add Das to DaMa

then test starting with helper functions




got through each row and push values onto columns or vice versa?
how to construct new Da's
how to fill - integers only?


--------------------

here, change da_exists to return a pointer to the element, or a NULL pointer   (NULL being false, doesn't exist)
