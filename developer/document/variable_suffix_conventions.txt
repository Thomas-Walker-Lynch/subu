# Suffix Conventions

## Specify interface used with variable when clarification is useful

- `_set`: Indicates that the variable holds a set of items.

- `_list`: Used for variables that represent a list of items.

- `_f`: Refers to a function.

Instead of making a variable name plural, add the interface qualifier.

   e.g. names ->  name_set  or name_lisst

## Always a good idea to use these when working with files

- `_fp`: Refers to a file path. The part after the last slash is a file name.

- `_afp`: Refers to an absolute file path.
  
- `_dp`: Refers to a directory path. By convention, the value ends in a slash.

- `_adp`: Refers to an absolute directory path. 

- `_fn`: Refers to a file name. Value has no slashes.

- `_dn`: Refers to a directory name. Value has no slashes.
  
- `_fn_base`: The file name without the last dot and subsequent characters.
  
- `_fn_ext`: The subsequent characters after the last dot in a file name.
