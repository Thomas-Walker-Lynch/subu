the group sticky bit scheme has an interesting drawback, the group owner can not
change permissions of a file owned by the subu.  Hence the administrative user who
is a group owner can not act like an admin.  Will need to use facl instead.

ran across this because Lustucru, who is a repo user, can not adjust permissions of
repo files *and vice versa*.  If Lustru creates a file, the group is appropriatly
sticky, and becomes 'repo',  but as Lustcru *owns* such files the repo user may
not adjust their permissions.

Hence, if the admin owns a file, though it is group of the subu, the subu can
not change permissions (can not make them more permissive, or not change them at all?).

Combine the repo and subu commands into one. activate becomes bashrc?  add an archive script
for each subu, and a push script for each repo.

repo is similar to subu, but it does not login.  Thus the environment of the caller is
still available. subu handles environment sharing through a shared bashrc file.  This would
also work for repo.

perhaps leave repo as a script, then source the script as part of the bashrc of a subu.  I.e.
each repo would be a subu, only different due to running the repo script.
