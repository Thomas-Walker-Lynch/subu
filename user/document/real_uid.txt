Real uid is a poorly named term for the uid of the user who launched the
process.  The uid that the process has been set to is the effective uid.  There
is a third stored uid in a process's record.  Hence the uid being used by the
OS will be set to one of these.

Our subu-mk-0 program wants to create a subservient user to a master user.  The
master user is known via the real uid.  The effective user will be that of root,
as the script needs root privilege to run adduser.

sudo resets the real uid, and there is no reliable approch then to create a subu-mk-0
program run by sudo.  A setuid root program is needed.  Only compiled executables can
be setuid root on linux.

There is an environment variable given to programs run by sudo, $SUDO_USER. Sudo sets
it, so if called from sudo then that works. It could be set by another user, even
if that user is root or not.

I will make a setuid C program.  Too bad, had written this in Python.
