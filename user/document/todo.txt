the group sticky bit scheme has an interesting drawback, the group owner can not
change permissions of a file owned by the subu.  Hence the administrative user who
is a group owner can not act like an admin.  Will need to use facl instead.

ran across this because Lustucru, who is a repo user, can not adjust permissions of
repo files *and vice versa*.  If Lustru creates a file, the group is appropriatly
sticky, and becomes 'repo',  but as Lustcru *owns* such files the repo user may
not adjust their permissions.

Hence, if the admin owns a file, though it is group of the subu, the subu can
not change permissions (can not make them more permissive, or not change them at all?).
