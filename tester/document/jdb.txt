About `jdb`

1. setting the environment

  The environment should be set before running the IDE. For example,

  > cd Mosaic
  > source env_tester
  > emacs & 

  (I use emacs as my IDE. You might be using a different tool.)

2. location of the executable

  Provided that the project administrator installed it, jdb is located in the
  third_party tools directory. In the tester environment the variable
  `JAVA_HOME` should hold the jdb directory path, and this should already
  be in the `PATH`.  For example:

  > echo $ENV
  tester/tool/env

  > echo $JAVA_HOME
  /var/user_data/Thomas-developer/Mosaic/tool_shared/third_party/jdk-11

  > which jdb
  /var/user_data/Thomas-developer/Mosaic/tool_shared/third_party/jdk-11/bin/jdb

3. invocation from a shell command:

     jdb -sourcepath $SOURCEPATH <class_name>

   The `SOURCEPATH` is assigned a value in `tester/tool/env`.  In some versions
   of jdb there is no space between `-sourcepath` and the `$SOURCDEPATH`.  

   jdb will read CLASSPATH from the environment. In contrast jdb will not read
   `SOURCEPATH` from the environment. It must be passed as an argument.

   There is a `run_jdb` script in the `tool` directory.

4. invocation inside of Emacs

   The file `tool_shared/bespoke/emacs.el` holds a definition for the `jdbx`
   command.  This command will read the SOURCEPATH from the environment and run
   jdb in Emacs.

   That file also holds the definition for a listener to the jdb `sourcepath`
   command.
