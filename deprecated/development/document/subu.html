  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>A system will have a number of user accounts.  Each user may in turn have a
    number of sub-user accounts, aka subu accounts.</p>

  <p>A subu account is much like any other user account.  It has an entry in
    /etc/passwd, and a home directory. The subu user account will also be mounted
    under /home.  Direct login to the subu might be barred, though that is not
    necessarly the case.</p>

  <p>Whereas a user account is administered by the root user.  A subu account is
    administered by the user who created it.  The creating user is said to be the
    owner. Because a subu account is much like any other account, a root user can
    also administer a subu account.</p>

  <p>A user runs <span class='code'>subu_add &ltname&gt</span> to create a subu account.  For practical reasons,
    the account name in /etc/password will show up as <span class='code'>`&ltuser&gt-&ltname&gt`</span>, where 
    <span class='code'>&ltuser&gt</span>
    is the user's username and <span class='code'>&ltname&gt</span> is the name the user gave to the subu.
    The subu account will also show up under the directory <span class='code'>&ltuser&gt/subu</span>.</p>

  <p>To user a subu account, the user first logs into his or her user account.  Then
    the user runs the command  <span class='code'>subu &ltname&gt &ltapp&gt</span> to enter the sub user.
    The <span class='code'>&ltapp&gt</span> will then be opened while logged-in as the subu.</p>

  <p>Files in the subu directory are owned by the subu. Depending on the umask these
    may or may not be readable/writable by other users, including other subu. *Linux
    User Beware* gnome ignores the user umask, and makes all files world
    readable. Linux has been like this for years.  My most common app to open
    in the subu is <span class='code'>emacs</span>, so the umask is followed.  If no <span class='code'>&ltapp&gt</span> is specified,
    then a terminal is opened.<p>

  <h1>Directory Structure</h1>

  <p>Each subu has a home directory under <span class='code'>/home/&ltuseer&gt-&ltname&gt</span>. Each subu
    is also file system mounted with ownship ship translations under <span class='code'>/home/&ltuseer&gt/subu</span>.
    Hence the user may move a file around between subu and the file ownership will automatically map to be
    owned by the subu it is found under.</p>
  
  <p>There are two special directories under <span class='code'>/home/&ltuseer&gt/subu</span>, one has the
    same name as the user, the other is called <span class=

  <h1>Issues</h1>

  <h2>Where to put a subu home directory</h2>

  <p>Initially these were placed under the user directory. However, that meant that the user's home directory
    had to have execute permission to the world so the subu could get to their home directory.  So the subu
    were then moved to <span class='code'>/home</span>.</p>

  <h2>sudo RealID bug</h2>

  <p>Real uid is a poorly named term for the uid of the user who launched the
    process.  The uid that the process has been set to is the effective uid.  There
    is a third stored uid in a process's record.  Hence the uid being used by the
    OS will be set to one of these.</p>

  <p>Our subu-mk-0 program wants to create a subservient user to a master user.  The
    master user is known via the real uid.  The effective user will be that of root,
    as the script needs root privilege to run adduser.</p>

  <p>sudo resets the real uid, and there is no reliable approch then to create a subu-mk-0
    program run by sudo.  A setuid root program is needed.  Only compiled executables can
    be setuid root on linux.</p>

  <p>There is an environment variable given to programs run by sudo, $SUDO_USER. Sudo sets
    it, so if called from sudo then that works. It could be set by another user, even
    if that user is root or not.</p>

  <p>I will make a setuid C program.  Too bad, had written this in Python.</p>
